### Questions

- At page 706 in the Deep Learning textbook, author states that a linear autoregressive model is just another way to formulate a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Why is this so? 
Similarly, when talking about Generative Moment Matching Networks he states that a multivariate Gaussian can only capture linear relationships between variables. Why?
